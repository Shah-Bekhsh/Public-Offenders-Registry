"# Public-Offenders-Registry" 
This is my undergrad thesis project.

The goal behind this project was to store Police records (offender data) on Ethereum blockchain using Smart Contracts.

Created a neat application around that smart contract which allows me to view all previously stored records and add more.

Thanks for checking my project out.
